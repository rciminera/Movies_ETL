By Bob Ciminera

## Overview

Amazing Prime Video would like to develop an algorithm to determine which low budget movie being released will be popular so they can purchase the streaming rights at a bargain,  

In order to have some fun with this, they are sponsoring a hackathon with a clean dataset of movie data and asking participants to predict the poular pictures.

A data set for the event has been created from 2 data sources:  scrape of Wikipedia for movies released since 1990 and rating data from the MovieLens website.

Following the ETL process, the data was Extracted from the 2 sources, Transformed by cleaning and joining into 1 data set, and finally Loaded into an SQL database.
