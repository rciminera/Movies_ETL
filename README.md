## Overview

Amazing Prime Video plans to develop an algorithm to determine which low budget movie being released will be popular so they can purchase the streaming rights at a bargain,  

In order to have some fun with this, they are sponsoring a hackathon and will provide a clean dataset of movie data to participants as input to their programs to predict popular pictures.

This data set for the event has been created from a scrape of Wikipedia for movies released since 1990 and rating data from the MovieLens website.

Following the ETL process, the data was Extracted from the 2 sources, Transformed by cleaning and joining into 1 data set, and finally Loaded into an SQL database.
